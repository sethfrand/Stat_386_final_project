This tutorial demonstrates how to use the utah_housing_stat386 package to scrape, clean,
and analyze Utah housing data from UtahRealEstate.com.
The package provides tools to collect data from cities in Utah County and Salt Lake County.

## Installation ##
*The first things that you will need to do is install the utah_housing_stat386 package.*
pip install utah-housing-stat386

```bash
import utah_housing as
```
After installing, you'll also need to install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) browers
to run the scraping functions.

This package includes a demo datset that you can use so that you can start exploring the data immediately!

```python
from utah_housing_stat386 import demo_data

#load the demo dataset

df = load_demo_data()

#Display the basic information of the dataset

print(f"Dataset Shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"\nDataset Columns: {df.columns}")
print(f"\nDataset Description: \n{df.describe()}")
print(f"\nFirst few rows: \n{df.head()}")
```

## Understanding the Data ##
To understand the datatypes that we can, you can run

```python
print("Data Types:"
print(df.dtypes())

print("\nSummary Statistics:")
df.describe()

```
